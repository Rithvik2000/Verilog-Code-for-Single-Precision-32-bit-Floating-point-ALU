# Verilog code for single Precision 32 bit Floating point ALU
This ALU performs Arithmetic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division on Two 32-bit Floating Point Numbers. It also computes Natural Logarithm of a given number.

The following are the opcodes for different operations.
////////////// 001 = Addition  
////////////// 010 = Subtraction  
/////////////  011 = Multiplication  
/////////////  100 = Division  
////////////// 101 = Comparator  , 100(A>B) ,010 (A<B), 001(A=B)
